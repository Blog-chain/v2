### Summary

A `sidechain` is a separate blockchain that runs independently and is connected to Mainnet.

### Description

Sidechains can have separate block parameters and consensus algorithms, which are often designed for efficient processing of transactions. Unlike layer 2 scaling solutions, sidechains do not post state changes and transaction data back to Mainnet.
